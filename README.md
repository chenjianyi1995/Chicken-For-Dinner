# Description:
# 	Our project was focused on death and other such player data from the game
# 	PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUND (hereafter refered to as PUBG).
#	We used this data to attempt to create a sort of survival guide for the game.
#	A guide that would help player's survive longer in a match in an attempt to win.
#	It would do this by giving the player's certain choices in weapons or modes of
#	transportation one should make in order to survive longer.
#
# Summary:
#	For this project we wanted to know the answer to the question of how to win the 
#	game PUBG. To answer this question we asked whether luck or skill had higher 
#	precedence when it came to the victors, expecting that it would be skill.
#	And based on our analysis of these values we were able to determine what sort
#	of strategies those with high skill utilized in order to win games.
