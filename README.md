# Description:
# 	Our project was focused on death and other such player data from the game
# 	PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUND (hereafter refered to as PUBG).
#	We used this data to attempt to create a sort of survival guide for the game.
#	A guide that would help player's survive longer in a match in an attempt to win.
#	It would do this by giving the player's certain choices in weapons or modes of
#	transportation one should make in order to survive longer.
#
# Summary:
#	For this project we wanted to know the answer to the question of how to win the 
#	game PUBG. To answer this question we asked whether luck or skill had higher 
#	precedence when it came to the victors, expecting that it would be skill.
#	And based on our analysis of these values we were able to determine what sort
#	of strategies those with high skill utilized in order to win games.
#	In answer to our questions, we found that skill had higher precedence, we 
#	generated graphs that will help players decide where to jump and where to travel
#	in the early game, as well as which weapons are most used on which ranges to 
#	assist in their choice of which weapon they should take to increase their
#	chances of victory the most.
#
# Application:
#	Our application of our knowledge is a sort of survival guide. We play enough of
#	the game PUBG to know that winning is a very difficult, and sometimes a seeemingly
#	impossible feat. For help on which location to go at which time a player can look
#	at the maps and clusterings we made, and based on the score of the cluster, will
#	be able to decide whether or not they want to go there. And as to which weapon to
#	choose, the player will be given a comprehensive list of which weapons are most
#	used at which ranges. After that, all they need to do is figure out which combination
#	works best for them.
